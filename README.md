# Neural-Net-Minus
Neural Net Minus is a simple neural netowrk library I built completely from scratch.

I implemented the forward and back propagation using only the numpy library.

Why? Because I was interested in the topic and I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the vanilla neural network. At least that was why I started, and eventually I was too invested to not finish.
