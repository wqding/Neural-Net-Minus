# Neural-Net-Minus
<img src="Neural_Net_Minus.png" width="40%">
Neural Net Minus is a simple neural netowrk library I built completely <strong>from scratch</strong>.
    
I implemented the forward and back propagation using only the numpy library.


This library gives users access to the following hyperparamters:
<ul>
   <li>number of layers</li>
   <li>number of nodes in each layer</li>
   <li>learning rate</li>
   <li>activation function at each node</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why?</h2> 
Because I was interested in the topic and I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the vanilla neural network. 


...at least that was why I started. Once I realized the huge task I had taken on, I simply couldn't bear the thought(and the hit to my ego) of not finishing after I've invested so much time already.

<h2>To use the library:</h2>
1. Move the Neural_Net_Minus.py file to your project directory <br/><br/>
2. import Neural_Net_Minus.py in the file you want to use it: <br/><br/>
    <i>import Neural_Net_Minus as NNM</i><br/><br/>
