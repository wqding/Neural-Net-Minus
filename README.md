# Neural-Net-Minus
<img src="Neural_Net_Minus.png" width="40%">
Neural Net Minus is a simple neural netowrk library I built completely from scratch.

I implemented the forward and back propagation using only the numpy library.

Why? Because I was interested in the topic and I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the vanilla neural network. At least that was why I started, and eventually I was too invested to not finish.

To use the library:
1. Move the Neural_Net_Minus.py file to your project directory
2. import Neural_Net_Minus.py in the file you want to use it: 
  * import Neural_Net_Minus as NNM
  
Please reference XOR_example.py to see an example
